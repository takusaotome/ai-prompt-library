prompt: |
  Front-facing Shiba Inu in a rough, hand-drawn Japanese mascot (yuru-chara) style,
  sitting politely with only the two front legs visible, **no back legs at all**.
  ▸ Proportions & posture:
      – The dog is seated with a **very large, vertically long head** (about 75% of total height), and a small, very short rectangular body (about 25%).
      – The **entire head, including chin and jaw, is fully enclosed with an extremely thick, uneven, hand-drawn black outline**—no gaps anywhere around the head.
      – The face is vertically elongated (not round or chubby).
      – Only two straight, thick front legs are visible, spaced apart, attached directly to the lower body. **No back legs or side legs visible.**
  ▸ Outline:
      – Use extremely thick, highly uneven, hand-drawn black lines (at least 12–15% of width).
      – The **head's outline must go completely around the face, especially along the jaw and chin.**
      – Body is also fully outlined; **no extra legs, paws, or toes drawn.**
      – Corners and ends of lines are rounded, overlapping, and rough—like a child’s marker drawing.
  ▸ Face:
      – Eyes: two small solid black dots, close together and near the nose.
      – Nose: very large solid black oval, low on the face, touching the white muzzle.
      – Mouth: thick, short, black U-shaped line just under the nose; tongue peeking out, small and round.
      – **White muzzle area has no black outline around it; it is a white oval blended into the face, not circled.**
  ▸ Colors:
      – Fur: #B37829 (warm brown)
      – White: #FFFFFF
      – Tongue: #F89C7D
  ▸ Chest patch:
      – White patch from neck down between front legs, wide “Y” or loose triangle shape.
  ▸ Tail:
      – Short, simple, curved stub sticking out to the right, outlined thickly.
  ▸ Ears:
      – Two upright triangles, thick outline, slight asymmetry OK.
  ▸ Canvas:
      – Flat 2-D illustration on a transparent canvas or plain white background, no extra elements.

#  Prompt: “Generate Feature List + Fit-Gap Matrix from Meeting Notes”
#  Purpose:  Transform raw meeting minutes into a structured,
#            prioritised feature matrix (with Fit-Gap, phase, effort).
#  Usage:    Replace <<MEETING_MINUTES>> with the verbatim notes.

  You are an experienced Salesforce solution architect and business analyst.
  Your task is to read meeting minutes, extract every requirement, and produce
  a concise but comprehensive feature list with Fit-Gap analysis.
  Follow the step-by-step workflow described by the user.

<<MEETING_MINUTES>>

```

## Workflow (perform sequentially)
1. **Extract Requirements**  
   - Parse the minutes and list every distinct requirement / pain-point as a single-sentence bullet.  
   - Keep the language business-friendly.

2. **Group into Major Categories**  
   - Typical buckets: “CRM入力項目・テンプレート”, “赴任者受け入れタスク管理”,  
     “リマインド・メール”, “画面 UI”, “履歴・データ管理”,  
     “Ex Project 関連”, “Company Rule 管理”, “Opportunity / 商談”,  
     “Agent 管理”, “Rent 統合運用”.  
   - Add or rename buckets if the minutes suggest new themes.

3. **Assign Priority**  
   - H = Go-Live 必須 / M = Post-Go-Live / L = Future idea.  
   - Base the judgement on business impact & legal / operational urgency inferred from the minutes.

4. **Evaluate Fit-Gap**  
   - Use these four codes:  
     - OOB  … Standard Salesforce setup only  
     - CFG  … Click-based config (Flow, Dynamic Forms, etc.)  
     - CST  … Custom dev (Apex, LWC, integration)  
     - INT  … Third-party / AppExchange integration  
   - Choose the *highest* level needed (e.g., if 95 % is OOB but 5 % needs Apex, mark =CST).

5. **Propose Implementation Phase**  
   - Phase 1 = Include in initial MVP scope (usually all Priority H items).  
   - Phase 2 = Deliver in the first enhancement wave.  
   - Phase 3+ = Later / backlog.  
   - Adjust if dependencies imply a different rollout order.

6. **Rough Effort (人日)**  
   - Give a **whole-number estimate** for each line based on typical Lightning implementation speed.  
     - 0.5 – Minor config  
     - 1   – Standard Flow / list view / report  
     - 2-3 – Complex Flow, custom object with automation  
     - 4+ – Apex/LWC or integration.

7. **Output Table**  
   - Provide a Markdown table with the following columns:  
     | # | 大項目 | 機能 / 要望 | Priority | Fit&Gap | 対応方針（業務向け） | 技術案（開発向け） | 工数 (人日) | Phase |  
   - Keep rows sorted by #.  
   - Summarise 対応方針 in ≤ 120 chars; summarise 技術案 likewise.

8. **Append Glossary**  
   - After the table, include a short glossary that defines Priority and Fit-Gap codes (same wording as above).

## Output
Return only the Markdown content (table + glossary). Do **not** wrap the answer in triple back-ticks.
